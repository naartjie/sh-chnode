Chnode.sh
=========
[![NPM version][npm-badge]](http://badge.fury.io/js/chnode)
[npm-badge]: https://badge.fury.io/js/chnode.png

Change between installed Node versions in your current shell with a simple
`chnode VERSION`. Leaves the system version untouched. Works out of the box with
Mac's [Homebrew][homebrew].

### Tour
- Change only the current shell without affecting the rest of the system.
- Works out of the box with paths used by Mac's [Homebrew][homebrew].
- Extendable by adding more Node paths to the `NODES` variable.
- Leaves installing Node versions to your package manager thereby adhering to
  the *do one thing and do it well* principle.
- Works in Bash and Zsh. And possibly other POSIX compatible shells.
- Does not pollute your shell namespaces with internal functions.
- Lightweight.
- Written in the shell language. [KISS][kiss].

Side note: I'm terribly ashamed of not yet having tests!

### Differences
There are a few existing tools for switching Node versions, so how does
Chnode.sh differ?
- It **does not** manage installations.  
  Existing package managers (GNU/Linux distros', Homebrew etc.) do a better job
  of installing or compiling securely than such scripts.
- It's **really lightweight** — just a single shell function.  
  No build tools or compilers necessary.
- It changes the node version **only for the current shell session**.  
  Tools like [N][n] or [NVM][nvm] affect the entire system or all open shells.
  That's why if you need to test a single app in multiple Node versions,
  Chnode.sh comes very handy.

### Alternatives
If you do insist on compiling and installing Nodes via 3rd party tools, check
these out:
- [NVM][nvm]
- [N][n]
- [Nodist][nodist]

Installing
----------
Install Chnode.sh globally with:
```sh
npm install --global chnode
```

Then source it in your shell:
```sh
. "$(npm bin --global)/chnode"
```

For convenience you might want to put the **output** of the following in your
`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`.  
It'll be faster than running the line above with `npm bin` which will slow down
your shell loading.
```sh
echo ". \"$(npm bin --global)/chnode\""
```


Using
-----
Change between installed Node versions with:
```sh
chnode 0.11.7
```

To go back to the system version:
```sh
chnode system
```

### Options
Option           | Description
-----------------|------------
`-h, -?, --help `| Display this help.
`-l, --list     `| List all available Node versions.
`-r, --refresh  `| Refresh and find all available Node versions.
`-v, --version  `| Display version information.


Configuring
-----------
On the Mac Chnode.sh will find installed Nodes in `/usr/local/Cellar/node`.  
If you've got installations somewhere else, set the `NODES` variable to an
**array of paths** of **individual versions**:
```sh
NODES+=(~/.nodes/*)
```

For example, if you've got Node compiled from the source at
`~/Development/node-master`, append that:
```sh
NODES+=(~/Development/node-master)
```

If you think Chnode.sh should detect some of your paths automatically, please
let me know by [creating an issue][issues]. Thanks!
